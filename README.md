$ google-chrome-stable
[2522:2522:1201/201244.055528:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(157)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
